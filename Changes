Revision history for Perl extension Image::DS9.

0.104  Mon Aug 13 14:17:46 EDT 2001
        - ensured that the CTYPE? WCS keywords are surrounded by 
	  apostrophes

0.103
	- didn't create the wcs export tag

0.102
	- Forget Rg_file in export list
0.101
	- array() may now take a one-dimensional piddle
	- cleaned up detection of piddles

0.10
	Externals:
	- added invert option to colormap()
	- added save option to file()
	- added bin()
	- added crosshair()
	- added cursor()
	- added lower()
	- added raise()
	- added regions()
	- added wcs()
	- added view()
	- renamed T_Grid, T_Column, and T_Row to T_grid, T_column,
	  T_row

	- iconify() didn't return a true/false value (it directly
	  returned what DS9 sent it).
	- bugs fixed in display() code for queries which had errors
	- fixed up return for scale(S_limits) to be more consistent

	- Set() and Get() (low level access to XPA channel) are
	  now documented

	Internals:
	- cleaned up module setup code and creation of export tags
	- lots more error checking of arguments. this may make
	  following updates to DS9 a little more work, but makes
	  it easier for users of this module
	- improvements to documentation

0.09  Fri Sep  8 23:31:03 EDT 2000
	- confused max index with number of elements in check
	  for correct number of arguments for scale( 'limits' )

0.08  Wed Aug  2 12:15:40 EDT 2000
        - made compatible with API change in IPC::XPA v0.04.
	- _Get() now more flexible about chomping buf and messages;
	- implemented res_wanthash attribute
	- implemented verbose attribute
	- most ops arrays available as useful ones as @xxx_ops_dbg
	- cleaned up ops stuff a bit to make less problematic to add stuff
	- queries now take into account whether in list or scalar mode
          and return either the hash or the value of {buf}, respectively
	- added iconify(), mode(), orient(), rotate().
	- made scale(), zoom(), and display() queryable

0.07  Thu May 11 13:48:37 EDT 2000
	- max_servers could default to zero if no servers
	  were running; this would cause problems later if
	  one was started up.  it now defaults to at least one.
	- $self->{res} is always updated after Set.
	- the frame show command was incorrectly implemented.

	- renamed file ops to filetype

	- added display(), scale(), zoom()
	- returned buffers from Get are now chomped

	- added more frame op tags
	- made op tags more readable (lowercased)
	- added set_attrs method (not yet documented)
	- set max_servers to nservers() in the constructure
